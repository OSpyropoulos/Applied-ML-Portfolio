This repository contains three advanced data science projects completed as part of an Applied Machine Learning course. Final grade: **9.5/10** 🏆

## 🏠 Project 1: Exploring Airbnb in Athens

An in-depth analysis of Airbnb data in Athens, uncovering market trends and host behaviors.

### Key Features:
- Neighborhood listing analysis
- Price distribution across neighborhoods
- Availability trends
- Host distribution analysis
- Interactive map visualization

### Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Folium)
- Statistical Analysis
- Geospatial Visualization

## ✊ Project 2: Why Civil Resistance Works - Replication Study

A replication and extension of findings from [Why Civil Resistance Works](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/research/wcrw) by [Erical Chenoweth (Harvard](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/) and Maria J. Stephan.

### Key Features:
- Analysis of nonviolent vs. violent campaign success rates
- Investigation of the "3.5% rule"
- Logistic regression models
- Decade-wise trend analysis

### Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)
- Statistical Modeling
- Logistic Regression

## 📚 Project 3: Modernizing Roget's Thesaurus with NLP

Leveraging modern NLP techniques to analyze and update the classic hierarchical structure of Roget's Thesaurus.

### Key Features:
- Word embedding analysis
- Unsupervised clustering of words
- Supervised classification of thesaurus categories
- Comparison with original Roget's classification

### Tools Used:
- Python (NLTK, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Natural Language Processing
- Machine Learning (Clustering, Classification)
- Word Embeddings
