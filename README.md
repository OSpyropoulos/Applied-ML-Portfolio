This repository contains three advanced data science projects completed as part of an Applied Machine Learning course. Final grade: **9.5/10** 🏆

## 🏠 Project 1: Exploring Airbnb in Athens

An in-depth analysis of Airbnb data in Athens, uncovering market trends and host behaviors.

### Key Features:
- Neighborhood listing analysis
- Price distribution across neighborhoods
- Availability trends
- Host distribution analysis
- Interactive map visualization

### Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Folium)
- Statistical Analysis
- Geospatial Visualization

## ✊ Project 2: Exploring Why Civil Resistance Works

A replication and extension of findings from [Why Civil Resistance Works](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/research/wcrw) by [Erical Chenoweth (Harvard](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/) and Maria J. Stephan.

### Key Features:
- Analysis of nonviolent vs. violent campaign success rates
- Investigation of the "3.5% rule"
- Logistic regression models
- Decade-wise trend analysis

### Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)
- Statistical Modeling
- Logistic Regression
- Data Visualization

## 📚 Project 3: Roget's Thesaurus in the 21st Century

Leveraging modern NLP techniques to analyze and update the classic hierarchical structure of [Roget's Thesaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roget%27s_Thesaurus).

### Key Features:
- Word embedding analysis
- Unsupervised clustering of words
- Supervised classification of thesaurus categories
- Comparison with original Roget's classification

### Tools Used:
- Python (NLTK, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Natural Language Processing
- Machine Learning (Clustering, Classification)
- Word Embeddings

### 👀 Viewing the Projects

1. Navigate to the desired project folder.
2. Click on the `.ipynb` file to view the Jupyter notebook in GitHub's notebook viewer.
3. You can see all the code, analysis, and visualizations directly in your browser.

### 🔧 Future Development

For those interested in running these notebooks locally, we plan to add a `requirements.txt` file and setup instructions in the future. Stay tuned for updates!

### 📊 Results and Insights
Each project folder contains detailed Jupyter notebooks with analysis, visualizations, and key findings.
